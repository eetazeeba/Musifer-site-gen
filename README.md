## Hosting through GitHub Pages
- Deployment workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- Expected model: build `_site` from `main`, then deploy via Actions.
- Helpful docs:
  - [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)
  - [Configuring a publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
  - [Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

## Analytics investigation status (Plausible)
- Current status on `main` (2026-03-09): investigated/planning only; no Plausible script or analytics wrapper is implemented in tracked source.
- Investigation notes and proposed phases are tracked in `docs/planning/plausible-feasibility-and-implementation-plan.md`.
- Hosting context for analytics decisions:
  - Repo-documented deployment path remains GitHub Pages via Actions.
  - Netlify project linkage exists as `creative-cassata-f39fb9` (dashboard visibility context), but no Netlify deploy/config files are currently tracked in this repo.

## CMS notes
- CMS config is in `src/admin/config.yml`.
- `/admin` is intentionally not linked in public navigation until CMS access checks are complete.
- Local CMS test flow:
  1. `npm run start`
  2. `npm run cms:local`
  3. Open `http://localhost:8080/admin/`
