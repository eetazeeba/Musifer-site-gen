## Hosting through GitHub Pages
- Deployment workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- Expected model: build `_site` from `main`, then deploy via Actions.
- Helpful docs:
  - [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)
  - [Configuring a publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
  - [Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

## Analytics rollout status (Umami-first, vendor-agnostic)
- `experimental` status (2026-03-09): Phase 1 base insertion + env gating is implemented.
- `main` status (2026-03-09): Phase 1 is not merged yet.
- Detailed phases and implementation notes are tracked in `docs/planning/analytics-rollout-plan.md`.
- Phase 0 planning decisions are documented/locked in the analytics plan:
  - GitHub Pages baseline
  - `musifer.studio` primary / `musifer.art` backup domain direction
  - production-only initial rollout scope
  - finalized privacy/disclosure reference at `docs/planning/privacy-policy-draft.md`
- Phase 1 implemented contract on `experimental`:
  - `ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
  - `ANALYTICS_PROVIDER=umami`
  - `ANALYTICS_DOMAIN=musifer.studio`
- Hosting context for analytics decisions:
  - Repo-documented deployment path remains GitHub Pages via Actions.
  - Netlify project linkage exists as `creative-cassata-f39fb9` (dashboard visibility context), but no Netlify deploy/config files are currently tracked in this repo.

## CMS notes
- CMS config is in `src/admin/config.yml`.
- `/admin` is intentionally not linked in public navigation until CMS access checks are complete.
- Local CMS test flow:
  1. `npm run start`
  2. `npm run cms:local`
  3. Open `http://localhost:8080/admin/`
