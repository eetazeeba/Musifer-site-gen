# Contact Form Microsoft 365 Graph Setup

Purpose
- Record the Microsoft 365 / Exchange Online setup used by `api/contact.js` to send Contact form email via Microsoft Graph using certificate-based app authentication.

Current State
- `api/contact.js` accepts validated contact submissions and returns normalized JSON responses.
- SMTP AUTH/app-password workflow is deprecated for this project path.
- Graph API with Entra app certificate is the current implementation direction.

Recommended Delivery Path
- Use Microsoft Graph API `users/{sender}/sendMail` with OAuth2 client credentials and certificate-based client assertion.
- Keep sender and receiver mailbox defaults at `contact@musifer.studio` unless product requirements change.

Required Decisions
- Choose the sending mailbox account used by the site, for example a dedicated address such as `contact@musifer.studio`.
- Confirm whether the mailbox uses MFA.
- If MFA is enabled, confirm whether an app password is available or whether the tenant instead requires a Microsoft Graph API integration.
- Confirm the recipient address for site contact submissions. This can match the sending mailbox or route to a separate inbox.

Environment Variables
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO`
  - Inbox that receives contact submissions.
  - Example: `contact@musifer.studio`
- `CONTACT_SENDER_EMAIL`
  - Mailbox used as Graph sendMail user principal.
  - Example: `contact@musifer.studio`
- `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`
  - Entra application/client ID.
- `GRAPH_TENANT_ID`
  - Entra tenant ID.
- `GRAPH_CERT_THUMBPRINT`
  - SHA-1 certificate thumbprint used for the JWT `x5t` header.
- `GRAPH_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`
  - Private key PEM for signing client assertions.
- `CONTACT_RATE_LIMIT`
  - Optional. Requests allowed per minute per IP.
  - Current server default is `5` if unset.

Vercel Setup Steps
1. Open the Vercel project.
2. Go to Settings > Environment Variables.
3. Add `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` for Production, Preview, and Development as appropriate.
4. Add `CONTACT_SENDER_EMAIL` for the same environments.
5. Add `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` for the same environments.
6. Add `GRAPH_TENANT_ID` for the same environments.
7. Add `GRAPH_CERT_THUMBPRINT` for the same environments.
8. Add `GRAPH_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` for the same environments.
9. Optionally add `CONTACT_RATE_LIMIT` if the default of `5` should be overridden.
10. Redeploy after saving environment-variable changes.

Microsoft 365 / Entra Setup Steps
1. Confirm app registration has `Mail.Send` application permission with admin consent.
2. Confirm app certificate is uploaded to the Entra app registration and matches private key used in Vercel.
3. Confirm `CONTACT_SENDER_EMAIL` mailbox exists and app access policy allows send-as for that mailbox.
4. Confirm there is no Conditional Access or Exchange policy blocking app-only sends.

Implementation Steps In Code
1. Build a signed client assertion JWT in `api/contact.js` using `GRAPH_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` and `GRAPH_CERT_THUMBPRINT`.
2. Request an access token from the tenant token endpoint with client-credentials grant.
3. Call Graph `users/{sender}/sendMail` with the resulting token.
4. Build the outgoing message so the inbox receives:
   - sender name
   - sender email address
   - optional subject
   - full message body
   - timestamp or request metadata only if genuinely useful
5. Use `replyTo: formData.email` so replies go back to the person who submitted the form.
6. On Graph auth/send failure, log server-side details and return a normalized error result from `sendEmail()`.
7. Keep user-facing API responses generic; do not expose provider details to the client.

Suggested Runtime Values
- `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`: `c70a07da-501a-471e-9b9c-5f7091e97d1b`
- `GRAPH_TENANT_ID`: `c02e40f9-9673-46a4-8bfc-b371b1a44438`
- `GRAPH_CERT_THUMBPRINT`: `5BEE7A13E996820C2988C438CC3B364A0B039769`

Validation And Test Steps
1. Add the environment variables locally in `.env.local` or use `vercel env pull` for local testing.
2. Submit a valid message from the local contact form and confirm:
   - the API returns `200`
   - the success state renders in-page
   - the email arrives in `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO`
3. Submit multiple requests quickly to confirm the current rate-limit behavior still returns `429`.
4. Confirm invalid email or missing required fields still fail before network submission on the client.
5. Inspect Vercel function logs for Graph token or sendMail failures.

Fallback Path
- If certificate auth cannot be supported in deployment constraints, use a short-lived client secret plus secret rotation policy as a temporary fallback.

Notes
- Do not commit credentials to the repository.
- Keep `.env.local` local-only.
- Preserve the existing generic success and failure UI copy unless product requirements change.
