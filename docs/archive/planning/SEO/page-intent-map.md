# Musifer Page Intent Map

Status
- Primary: active
- Updated: 2026-05-12
- Current reference: docs/planning/SEO/strategy.md
- Note: Active intent mapping support doc.


Snapshot date: 2026-03-12 (branch `experimental`)

Purpose
- Map page purpose, search intent, conversion role, and indexing expectations across the current and planned Musifer site.
- Use this file with [strategy.md](strategy.md) for sitewide rules and [launch-checklist.md](launch-checklist.md) for launch QA.
- Treat [`../../sitemap.md`](../../sitemap.md) as the intended IA baseline when route names or nav data still differ in the repo.

## How to read this map
- "Intended route" reflects the sitemap-led IA direction.
- "Current implementation" records repo reality where it still differs.
- "Conversion role" describes the next action the page should support, even when the page is not fully implemented yet.

## Blog planning rules
`blog` deserves the strongest structural SEO treatment because it is the best long-term discovery surface in the current roadmap.

### Content buckets
- Keep the three public buckets already present in the sitemap and repo:
  - `guides`: evergreen how-to, checklists, explainers, process walkthroughs
  - `articles`: commentary, perspective, narrative, interpretation
  - `case-studies`: proof, breakdowns, before/after, applied lessons
- The CMS content model now stores a primary `bucket` slug on blog entries; keep public IA aligned to the three buckets above unless planning docs are updated first.
- Do not add more public buckets unless there is enough repeated content to justify a stable archive page.
- Give each article one primary public bucket.

### Evergreen vs timely
- Make evergreen content the default. It should carry the bulk of organic discovery.
- Use timely or news-reactive posts sparingly and only when they can:
  - be updated later
  - link into a more durable evergreen guide
  - support a clearly relevant service or contact pathway

### Tags and taxonomy restraint
- The current CMS model allows freeform tags, but public SEO should not depend on that taxonomy yet.
- Keep tags as editorial metadata and internal organization unless vocabulary governance becomes stricter.
- Do not launch public tag archive pages in v1.
- If tags later become public, normalize vocabulary first to avoid thin or duplicate archives.

### Article template expectations
- Every article should support:
  - unique title
  - summary/deck usable as meta description input
  - publish and updated dates
  - author
  - primary bucket
  - featured/share image expectation
  - at least one meaningful next-step link
- Avoid publishing article pages with no contextual links back into the site.

### Related-post logic
- First priority: manual `related_ids` when a strong editorial relationship exists.
- Fallback priority:
  - same bucket
  - same problem or workflow stage
  - adjacent service relevance
- Related-post modules should favor quality over count. Two or three strong matches are better than a noisy grid.

### Blog-to-services/contact pathways
- Guides should usually link to the service that helps with implementation or professional support.
- Case studies should usually link to the corresponding service and then to contact/quote.
- Articles can link more lightly, but they should still offer a plausible next step when the topic naturally invites one.
- End-of-article CTAs should match the reader's readiness:
  - informational follow-up: another article or guide
  - evaluation follow-up: service page
  - action follow-up: contact or quote path

## Current implementation gaps to reconcile
- The current blog library is still sparse, so the landing page and bucket hubs need ongoing editorial curation rather than archive-heavy expansion.
- The content model currently allows tag drift, so taxonomy exposure should stay restrained until governance improves.
- If future buckets are introduced in CMS data, update IA/navigation/planning docs before exposing new public hub pages.
