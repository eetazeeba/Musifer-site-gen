# CSS Conflict Audit - 2026-03-06 (Compact Tray Alignment)

Source of truth
- Planning reference: `docs/responsive-layout-navigation-refresh-plan.md`
- This audit supersedes `docs/audits/css-refresh-conflict-audit-2026-03-06.md`.
- Audit mode: review and documentation only (no implementation changes).

Scope reviewed
- `docs/responsive-layout-navigation-refresh-plan.md`
- `src/_includes/header.html`
- `src/_assets/scripts/header-nav.js`
- `src/_assets/CSS/_nav.scss`
- `src/_assets/CSS/header-nav.css`

Visual Direction Inputs
- Directional screenshot provided in the 2026-03-06 nav review thread indicates a compact tray target of a narrow right-aligned panel aligned with the hamburger side.
- This is currently treated as temporary directional input until implementation validation screenshots are captured and archived.

Stabilization diagnostic note (2026-03-06)
- Root cause of the compact "small top window" regression: `position: fixed` drawer styling was nested under a header element with a persistent base `transform`, creating a transformed containing block and clipping drawer height to header context.
- Stabilization direction: remove persistent base transform from the header resting state, keep transform on hidden/reveal states only, and scope drawer geometry explicitly to hamburger-visible breakpoints.

Resolved since commit `70419df`
- Wordmark prominence and lockup balance were improved.
- Desktop top-level item delineation was strengthened.
- Parent-link/toggle control affordance was improved.
- No JS or header structure changes were introduced.

## Phase 3 closure status (2026-03-06)
- Compact tray geometry refactor is complete.
- Dropdown toggle icon refactor is complete.
- Prior Phase 3 conflicts in this audit are now considered resolved for this branch state.
- Phase 1/2 behavior contracts were preserved through the refinements:
  - Phase 2 header hide/reveal scroll behavior
  - Phase 3 desktop dropdown behavior
  - compact disclosure/accordion behavior

## Screenshot reference cleanup note
- Directional references for this pass were chat attachments, not committed screenshot assets.
- Placeholder-only screenshot tracking folders were removed from `docs/screenshots/` to avoid asset clutter.

## Phase 4 planning watchpoints (carry-forward)
1. Utility boundary discipline between layout primitives and module-specific component styles.
2. Scroll-snap rail overflow/focus behavior across touch and keyboard interaction.
3. Breakpoint consistency for stacked defaults, rails, and multi-column variants without regressing existing nav/header behavior.
4. Avoiding accidental scope expansion into CMS/template architecture during Phase 4 CSS utility/component work.

## Current status summary
1. Phase 1: complete.
2. Phase 2: complete.
3. Phase 3: complete (baseline + refinements, including tray geometry and icon/toggle refactor).
4. Phase 4: pending, planning-only.
